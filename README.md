# Jesi NFT art Marketplace

A website to sell my generative art

## Development instructions

The webpage is built with Next.js and Tailwindcss for the front/back end. To download and collaborate, follow the steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine `git clone https://github.com/jesi-rgb/jesinftart.git`
2. The first time you download it need to run `npm i`, which will download all the dependencies under the `./node_modules` folder
3. When that's finished, run `npm run dev`, and a local server will boot up in the port specified in the terminal. Now you can live edit the webpage and changes will appear.
4. Next time you want to edit the webpage, simply `cd` into the folder and `npm run dev`.
